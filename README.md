# hello-world
First repository of mine, created via help of [**GitHub's useful tutorial**](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)!

My name is **_Ivan_**, I'm 22 years old (as of the time of writing, october 2020) and  just starting my journey in Programming!
As of now, I've studied a bit of different languages: **HTML**, **Python**, **JavaScript** and also **SQL**. For now, the most interesting one for me is _JavaScript_, as it is easy enough to learn "From scratch" and also has really diverse list of applications. So, right now the plan is to get some junior-level projects on here, and then apply for a job to get experience and the some motivation to get me going. In Moscow, there is a huge market of those in need of a _programmer_, so I intend to fulfill some of their needs! Maybe, I'll go as far as to try applying for **_NVIDIA_**, because who knows - maybe, I'll get lucky?..
At least, I hope that this craft is suitable for me and will one day become my passion - there I can apply all of my creativity, intelligence and diversity, and the possibilities are virtually endless! 

_Wish me luck, because I already did for those, who read this_!

# hello-world
First repository of mine, created via help of GitHub's useful tutorial!

My name is Ivan, I'm 22 years old (as of the time of writing, october 2020) and  just starting my journey in Programming!
As of now, I've studied a bit of different languages: HTML, Python, JavaScript and also SQL. For now, the most interesting one for me is JavaScript, as it is easy enough to learn "From scratch" and also has really diverse list of applications. So, right now the plan is to get some junior-level projects on here, and then apply for a job to get experience and the some motivation to get me going. In Moscow, there is a huge market of those in need of a programmer, so I intend to fulfill some of their needs! Maybe, I'll go as far as to try applying for NVIDIA, because who knows - maybe, I'll get lucky?..
At least, I hope that this craft is suitable for me and will one day become my passion - there I can apply all of my creativity, intelligence and diversity, and the possibilities are virtually endless! 

Wish me luck, because I already did for those, who read this!
